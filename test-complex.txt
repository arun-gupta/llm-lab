Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by enabling machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data. Companies like Google Health and IBM Watson are developing AI-powered diagnostic tools. Machine learning models can process large datasets to identify patterns in patient symptoms and medical records. Deep learning techniques are being used for medical imaging analysis, helping radiologists detect diseases like cancer more accurately. Natural language processing helps extract insights from clinical notes and research papers.
